    <p>Elon Musk cofounded the electronic payment firm PayPal,<br> 
         and in 2002 he founded SpaceX, a company that makes<br> rockets and spacecraft. He was a major early funder of <br>
          Tesla, which makes electric cars and batteries, and 
          <br>became its chief executive officer in 2008.<br>
          Microsoft’s current CEO, Satya Nadella, takes almost<br>
           the complete opposite approach: He puts the<br> company’s people first, he told<br> Harvard Business Review in 2021. Empathy is
           <br> “at the heart of design thinking,” said Nadella, <br> who assumed the role in 2014. ”[It’s] the source of all innovation.”</p>

        <p>Musk has become well-known for seemingly impulsive decisions and controversial statements on his social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter. That reckless streak can’t be separated out from Musk’s track record of innovation at companies like Tesla and SpaceX, Isaacson told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Tuesday.

            “He has these enraging qualities, these drives and these demons, but if you pull those out, you don’t have the impulsive character that sets things off,” said Isaacson, who shadowed Musk for two years while researching his book, which published on Tuesday.
            
            Specifically, Musk’s willingness to take chances and speak his mind helped make him the world’s richest person and one of its most powerful entrepreneurs, the biographer said: “If you don’t have the whole cloth of Elon Musk, you’re not going to get the innovation.”
            
            None of that excuses Musk’s “bad behavior,” like taking his “foul mood” out on his employees or challenging Mark Zuckerberg to a physical fight, Isaacson noted. And multiple other successful but hard-charging tech icons have recently expressed remorse about how they have treated their employees.
            
            Mark Cuban, for example, regrets making his team suffer through his laser-focus on results and productivity earlier in his career. “I wish somebody would have told me to be nicer,” Cuban told the “Bio Eats World” podcast in June. “Because I was always go, go, go. ... Ready, fire, aim. Let’s go. Let’s go faster, faster.”
            
            Bill Gates’ fixation on results made him an overbearing boss at Microsoft, he told students at Northern Arizona University’s commencement ceremony in May.
            
            “I didn’t believe in vacations. I didn’t believe in weekends. I didn’t believe the people I worked with should either,” Gates said, adding that he didn’t realize he needed to change until he became a dad.</p>

        <p>Elon Musk cofounded six companies, including electric car maker Tesla, rocket producer SpaceX and tunneling startup Boring Company.
            He owns about 23% of Tesla between stock and options, and has pledged some of his shares as collateral for loans.
            SpaceX, founded in 2002, is worth $127 billion after a funding round in May 2022; it quadrupled its value in three years.
            Boring Company, which aims to defeat traffic, raised $675 million in April 2022 at a $5.7 billion valuation.
            Twitter's board agreed to sell the company to Musk for $44 billion in April 2022, after he disclosed a 9.1% stake and threatened a hostile takeover.
            The deal closed in October 2022 after Musk tried to back out and Twitter sued. Musk owns an estimated 74% of the company, which is now called X.</p>
